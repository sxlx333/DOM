//Structure: This is a traditional for loop where you manually control the iteration using an index variable (i). Control: You have access to the index (i), allowing you to use it in the loop body. This is useful if you need to know the current index or if you want to access other elements or data structures by index. Accessing Elements: You access elements in the collection using sectionTitleDOM[i]. Output: The console.log(i, sectionTitleDOM[i]); will print the index and the corresponding element in each iteration.


for (const titleDOM of sectionTitleDOM) {
    console.log(titleDOM);
}
// The for...of loop is used to iterate over each element in the sectionTitleDOM collection. During each iteration, titleDOM represents a single h2 element with the class section-title.The console.log(titleDOM) statement logs each h2 element to the console.

//When this code is run: The getElementsByClassName method will select the six h2 elements with the section-title class from the HTML. The for...of loop will iterate through each of these elements and log them to the console one by one.

//The traditional for loop provides access to the index (i), which can be useful for specific tasks (e.g., counting, conditional logic based on index). The for...of loop does not give you the index by default; it only gives you the value of each element.
// The for...of loop is more concise and easier to read when you only need to work with the elements themselves and donâ€™t need the index. The traditional for loop is more flexible if you need additional control over the iteration (like skipping elements or accessing the index).

The text is returned exactly as it appears in the HTML, including whitespace, line breaks, and hidden elements. Generally faster. Use Case: Extracting raw text, including hidden content. Scenarios where you need the exact content, including whitespace, without considering layout or visibility.

Use Case: Extracting text exactly as it is displayed to the user, for example, in screen readers or copying text that should match the visual appearance.
